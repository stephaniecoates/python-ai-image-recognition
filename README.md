# python-ai-image-recognition
This project exists for the purpose of learning. The goal with building it is to become more familiar with Python, AI model integration, IAM techniques, as well as brush up on React &amp; Typescript on the frontend.

## Project Outline

### **1. Project Overview**

- **Goal**: Create a web application that allows users to upload images for object recognition, using a pre-trained AI model. The system will include user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC), where different users have varying levels of access to the platform’s features.
- **Key Features**:
    - Image recognition using AI models (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras).
    - User authentication and authorization (OAuth/JWT).
    - Role-based access control (e.g., free vs. premium users).
    - Image upload and storage.
    - Dashboard for managing user data and viewing recognized objects in images.

### **2. Tech Stack**

- **Backend**:
    - Python (Flask or Django).
    - AI Libraries: TensorFlow or Keras (for image recognition).
    - IAM: OAuth 2.0 or JWT (for authentication and access control).
    - Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL (for user management and image metadata).
    - Object Storage: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or local file system (for image storage).
- **Frontend**:
    - React/Typescript.
    - Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Other Tools**:
    - Docker (for containerization).
    - Cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud for deployment).
    - Nginx or Gunicorn for production deployment.

### **3. System Features**

#### **Core Features**

1. **Image Recognition**:
    
    - **AI Model**: Use a pre-trained model like `MobileNetV2` or `InceptionV3` from TensorFlow/Keras for image classification. These models are trained on large datasets like ImageNet, making them suitable for identifying a wide variety of objects.
    - **Functionality**: When a user uploads an image, the AI model should process the image and return the recognized objects (e.g., labels such as "cat," "dog," "car").
    - **Extensions**: Add support for multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG) and batch processing (multiple uploads at once).
2. **Image Upload & Storage**:
    
    - **Upload**: Users can upload images via the web interface. Files should be validated (e.g., size, format) before processing.
    - **Storage**: Images are stored in a cloud-based object storage solution (e.g., AWS S3) or on the local file system. Store metadata (e.g., filename, upload date, user ID) in the database.
3. **Dashboard & Results Display**:
    
    - **User Dashboard**: Each user has a personal dashboard where they can see previously uploaded images and the recognized objects.
    - **Recognition Results**: For each image, display the objects identified by the AI model and their confidence scores (e.g., "Dog: 98%").

#### **Authentication & IAM Features**

1. **User Authentication**:
    
    - **OAuth 2.0 or JWT**: Implement user authentication using OAuth (Google, Facebook, etc.) or JWT (JSON Web Token). Ensure that users must log in before accessing the platform.
    - **Sign-up/Login**: Create routes for user registration and login, allowing new users to sign up with an email/password or third-party authentication (OAuth).
2. **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    
    - **User Roles**:
        - **Free Users**: Can upload a limited number of images per day and have basic image recognition features.
        - **Premium Users**: Can upload more images, process larger files, and get additional features (e.g., higher priority in processing, access to more advanced models).
        - **Admin**: Has full access to all user data and can manage users (e.g., banning or promoting users).
    - **Role-based Permissions**: Use decorators or middleware to enforce role-based access to certain routes (e.g., only premium users can access high-resolution image processing).
3. **Account Management**:
    
    - **User Profiles**: Allow users to view and update their account details, such as email, password, and subscription tier (free/premium).
    - **Subscription Management**: Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) to allow users to upgrade to premium accounts.

#### **Additional Features**

1. **Quota Management**:
    
    - Implement quotas based on user roles. Free users can upload a limited number of images per day (e.g., 5 images), while premium users have higher limits.
2. **Logging & Auditing**:
    
    - Track user activity, such as login/logout times, image uploads, and API usage. Admins should have access to an audit log.
3. **Error Handling**:
    
    - Handle invalid image formats, authentication failures, and other potential errors gracefully. Provide appropriate error messages to the user.
4. **Performance & Optimization**:
    
    - Add asynchronous processing for image uploads and recognition tasks (using Celery or Redis to handle background jobs).
    - Cache recognition results for repeated images to reduce load on the AI model.
